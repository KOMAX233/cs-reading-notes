- ## tables
  - store related data with same column structure
  - record/row
  - 3 basic tables:
    1. standard tables
      - single table
      - can be appended to or overwritten
      - all rows are scanned in queries
    2. date-sharded tables
      - consist of tables ending in `_YYYYMMDD` or `YYYYMMDD`
      - grouped in UI
      - actually separate tables
      ```sql
      SELECT ColumnName1, ColumnName2
      FROM TableName
      WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX = '20180501'
      ```
    3. partitioned tables
      - single table in UI
      - exist as single table
      - datais partitioned in memory by ingestion date
      - pesudo-column `_PARTITIONTIME` splits data by ingestion date
      ```sql
      SELECT ColumnName1, ColumnName2
      FROM TableName
      WHERE _PARTITIONTIME = '2018050'
      ```
    partitioned vs. sharded tables
    - partitioned preferred:
      - exist as single table
      - a set of schema descriptions and table tags to manage
      - data compliance easily checked
      - table, metadata includes all related data
      - ingested data automatically appended
      - can force a `_partitiontime` in `where`
      - 
- ## query issues with large tables solution:
  - reduce data requirements
  - distribute size-based limit
  - hash/mod: split into parallel
  - dataflow
  - reduce data size
  - remove unnecesary order by
  - further partition
  - sample from data subsets
